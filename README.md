# DIY-Arduino-Telescopic-Controller

Contains the .ino for the Arduino Pro Micro based USB-HID Controller

Supports ONLY XINPUT COMPATIBLE BOARDS 

REQUIRES Xinput USB Core to be flashed prior to uploading this code to your chip.(lookup ARDUINO XINPUT AVR)

Also HIGHLY Recommended to use the STLs as only reference as they are not perfect in measurement or quality.
